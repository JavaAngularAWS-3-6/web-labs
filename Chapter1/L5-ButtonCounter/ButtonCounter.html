   * Now that you understand how to retrieve elements from the DOM and how to change properties such as innerText
   * belonging to the DOM, let's do something more involved.
   * Every time the button is clicked, the number in the "count" element should increase by 1.
   * On top of grabbing the "count" and "button" elements, you will need to keep track of some variable representing
   * the current value in your code.
